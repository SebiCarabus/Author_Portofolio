Here was born this utopia where everyone is equal, and progress is the only thing that matters. The first Emperor, Paris I, was the one who laid the foundations for the exponential colonization of the galaxy. It is estimated that approximately fifty colonies were established per century! On average, every two years, a new planet was reached by humans, each developing immediately. How was this possible?</p>
